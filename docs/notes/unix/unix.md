```

## Redirection

Standard I/O streams:

| Stream | Description     | File descriptor |
| ------ | --------------- | --------------- |
| stdin  | Standard input  | 0               |
| stdout | Standard output | 1               |
| stderr | Standard error  | 2               |

### Redirecting input `<`

**stdin** usually takes input from the keyboard.

```shell
$ command < file.txt # Executing `command` with `file.txt` as the source of input
```

The output of one command can be redirected as the input for another with the `|` (pipe) character.

```shell
$ echo 'one two three' | tr a-z A-Z
ONE TWO THREE
```

Using [here document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document) and [here string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_string) with `<<` and `<<<` respectively:

```shell
$ tr a-z A-Z << END_TEXT
one two three
uno dos tres
END_TEXT
ONE TWO THREE
UNO DOS TRES

$ tr a-z A-Z <<< "one two three"
ONE TWO THREE
```

### Redirecting output `>`

Unless redirected, **stdout** shows its output to the terminal.

```shell
$ command > file.txt # Redirect output of `command` to `file.txt`
# This will clobber (overwrite) any existing data in `file.txt`

# To avoid clobbering, use `>>`
$ command >> file.txt
# This will append the output to the end of `file.txt`
```

Clobbering can be disabled by `set -o noclobber` [[\*](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/452865/are-there-any-disadvantages-of-setting-noclobber)]. If this is enabled but you want to temporary turn off noclobber for a single operation, use `>|`. To re-enable, use `set +o noclobber`.

### Redirecting error `2>`

Unless redirected, **stderr** shows the error messages to the terminal.

```shell
$ command 2> file.txt # Redirect errors from `command` to `file.txt`
$ command 2>> file.txt # Avoid clobbering

# To redirect stdout and stderr to the same file, use `2>&1`
$ command 2>&1 file.txt

$ ls | xargs du -sk 2> /dev/null
# Redirecting stderr to the `/dev/null` device
```

## Useful programs

### `tr`

Translate or delete characters.

```shell
> echo 'reddit' | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' # Change case from lowercase to uppercase
> echo 'reddit' | tr [:lower:] [:upper:] # Equivalent to above
REDDIT
```

### `tee`

Read from standard input and write to both standard output and one or more files.

```shell
# This will write the JSON response to `response.json` as well as stdout
> curl https://api.github.com/repos/google/zx | tee response.json
{
  "id": 364474335,
  "name": "zx",
  "full_name": "google/zx",
  "visibility": "public",
  "forks": 469,
  "owner": {
    "login": "google",
    "id": 1342004,
    ...
  ...
}
> cat response.json
{
  "id": 364474335,
  "name": "zx",
  "full_name": "google/zx",
  "visibility": "public",
  "forks": 469,
  "owner": {
    "login": "google",
    "id": 1342004,
    ...
  ...
}

# Useful options
# -a, --append: Append to the given file(s), do not overwrite
```

### `cut`

Remove sections from each line of files.

```shell
> cut -f 5 main.tsv # Output the fifth field from `main.tsv`

# Custom delimiter
> cut -d ":" -f 3- main.txt # Output the third through the last field from `main.txt`; Use `:` as delimiter
> cut -d "," -f 2,3 ratings.csv # Output only the 2nd and 3rd fields from `ratings.csv`; Use `,` as delimiter
> cut -d, -f 2,3 ratings.csv # Equivalent to above

> echo "This is an example." | cut -c3- # Output the third through the last character of the input
is is an example.

> cut -c1-20 <file> # Output the first through the 20th character of _each line_ of file
```

### `seq`

Print a sequence of numbers.

```shell
> seq 3 # Generate numbers upto 3
1
2
3

> seq -s " | " 7 # Use custom separator (default: `\n`)
1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7

> seq -s " " 10 14 # Generate numbers from 10 upto 14
10 11 12 13 14

> seq -s " " 10 2 14 # Skip every other number
10 12 14

> seq -s " " 10 -2 6 # Going backwards
10 8 6

> seq -w 7 12 # Equalize width by padding with leading zeroes
07
08
09
10
11
12

> echo {0..9} # Alternative to `seq`
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

### `split`

```shell
# Generates files named `xaa`, `xab`, `xac`, etc
split file # Split `file` into 1000-line files
split -l 10 file # Split `file` into 10-line files (except the last line)
split -n 5 file # Split `file`, each split with equal size (except the last line)
split -b 512 file # Split `file` with 512 bytes in each split (except the last line) (512k for kilbobytes, 512m for megabytes)
split -C 512 file # Split `file` with at most 512 bytes in each split without breaking lines
```

### `csplit`

```shell
# Generates files named `xx00`, `xx01`, `xx02`, etc and prints size of each split in bytes to stdout
csplit file 5 23 # Split a file at lines 5 and 23
csplit file 5 {*} # Split a file every 5 lines (this will fail if the total number of lines is not divisible by 5)
csplit -k file 5 {*} # Split a file every 5 lines, ignoring exact-division error
csplit file 5 -f prefix # Split a file at line 5 and use a custom prefix for the output files
csplit file /regex/ # Split a file at a line matching a regular expression
```
